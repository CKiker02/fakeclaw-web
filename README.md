## What is this

FakeClaw is a parody AI company website. It looks real. It does nothing. That's the point.

Built as a joke. Deployed by accident (in spirit). Powered by **Null Engine v0.0.1**.

---

## The Lore

In 2021, a developer named Chad accidentally hit deploy on a file called `main_FINAL_v3_BROKEN.py`. He meant to delete it. FakeClaw went live. Nobody noticed. Nobody could fix it. So they called it AI and made a website.

The code has always done nothing. It will continue to do nothing.
